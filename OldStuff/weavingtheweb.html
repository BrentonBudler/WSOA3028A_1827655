             The Document That Changed It All
            </h3>

            <p>
                The World Wide Web has a diverse and elaborate history full of innovation and milestones. When looking back on it there are so many critical events that lead to creation of the advanced, interlinked information system we know it to be today. One of these events, that I consider to be absolutely pivotal in this development process occurred on April 30th 1993. The directors at CERN declared that WWW technology would be freely usable by anyone with no fees being payable to CERN. Web inventor Time Bernes-Lee explains in his book Weaving the Web that this was happened at a very tense time that could have potentially ruined the Web’s goal of becoming a ubiquitous, open communication platform. Just think about the billions of webpages that are accessed around the world every day, according to millforbusiness.com the average internet user surfs 120 pages a day. It is obvious that using required payments to restrict access to parts of the World Wide Web would have been detrimental to its development and public acceptance. But thanks to this one declaration by CERN, the Web exploded globally with no company ever being able to out-develop the masses and take control of the web.

                The World Wide Web 
               </h3>

               <p> 
                Tim Bernes-Lee’s 1994 article The World-Wide Web is also a fascinating insight into the early stages of web development and what it was envisioned to be. The article part explores the uses of various aspects of the web such as servers, links, menus and directories. It also goes on to look at what W3 defines and it’s interesting to see how the terminology and function of these aspects are still similar, almost 30 years later. Later on in the article W3 is compared to other information systems that were prevalent at the time namely WAIS and Gopher and although this article explains how W3 “fits in” with these other systems we know that it will eventually go on to dominate them and becoming the most use information system.

            <h3>
                The Promise and Peril of User Generated Content
            </h3>

            <p>
                User Generated Content (UGC) defined as any form of content, such as images, videos, text and audio, that has been posted by users on online platforms. From the perspective of a brand or a business this content brings both new opportunities and risks to the table. The key benefit that this content provides is that it is authentic and people are more likely to trust it because it is created by other people. Research shows that 92% of consumers trust people more than they trust advertising That is why we are so quick to base decisions off which movie we want to watch or which restaurant we want to eat at on reviews that other people have written rather than just watching the trailer or looking at the menu. Another key benefit that this content provides is improved reach, this content is more likely to be shared by other people meaning more consumers will be exposed to the brand or business. On the other hand, there are a number of risk factors this content elicits. The creation of negative content that can damage the business, and more than that this content could result in legal consequence. For the sake of the business this content needs to be continuously monitored as this content is unpredictable and can cause harm.

            <h3>
                Changing Technologies and Internet Culture 
            </h3>

        <p> 
            Different cultures have existed in different communities around the world throughout history but due to changes and developments in technology the use of the World Wide Web has resulted in the emersion of a global community in which “internet culture” has started to arise. Within this culture people are able to share and discuss ideas on a wide array of topics, regardless of who they are or where they come from. This process of sharing an idea, behaviour or style through imitation from person to person within a culture has been labelled as a “meme” and because of the interconnectivity of the world wide web as a medium these memes are able to spread across the world and become a universal ideology. But this power of information that can be spread globally in a matter of minutes also poses a unique threat; fake news. The online audience is a very large and susceptible one, often people believe everything they read on the internet and share things before validating the information from several different sources. This gullibility often leads to false information being spread and believed by millions. This in turn can have devastating effects on the global society and market place.

        <h3>
            URL Structures 
        </h3>

        <p> 
            I think the importance of a well structed URL cannot be stressed enough. The decisions that you make about your URL when developing a website will have a prolific knock-on effect on how people interact with your website and how many people visit it. Not only does a well-structed URL allow for ease of use and an improved user experience as people are able to easily understand the destination of the page they are on but it also helps with rankings in Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) in other words how high up on a search engine’s results the web page will appear. I think it is imperative to always ensure the URL is optimized and semantically accurate.
