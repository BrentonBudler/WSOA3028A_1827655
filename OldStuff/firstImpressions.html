                At first the concept explored in the Library of Babel is rather difficult to wrap your head around. As humans we struggle to conceptualize exactly how big infinity is. But as you come to terms with the fact that in an infinitely large library of books with infinite iterations of randomly ordered letters there could be very well be a book that contains your name; and even your whole life story. I think parallels can be drawn between this and the almost infinite size of the internet. The fact that Borges was already envisioning the idea of such a large, interconnected center of information in the year 1944 shows that the idea of something like the internet was present in human consciousness long before technology caught up to it.

            In the Garden of Forking Paths I think the primary take away is the idea of Ts’ui Pen’s novel (and Garden) branching out into new multiple narrative universes how similar that process is to clicking a link on a webpage that takes you to another, and then another and again to a new webpage. I think if you had to retrace your steps you’d realize the “Paths” we follow on the internet as we browse it are similar to the Paths in the Garden.

Lastly in As We May Think, it is scary how similar Vannevar Bush’s idea of a memex is to what we call the internet today. Although Bush envisioned the information to be stored using ultra high resolution micro-film reels and not servers like it actually is today. He was able to foresee the creation of some sort of collective memory machine where information is easily accessible which is essentially what the internet has become.
