        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p >The Fourth Industrial Revolution; an umbrella term for 3D-printing, artificial intelligence, big data, 
            industrial Internet of things, robotics and many other emerging technologies. It calls for corporations
             to rethink their strategies and business models and for Governments to change their policies to embrace 
             these technologies whilst mitigating their adverse socio-economic effects. But what would this mean for
              Africa as a whole and for South Africa in particular? “The Fourth Industrial Revolution- The Case of 
              South Africa” by Ewan Sutherland seeks to answer that question and explore what the Fourth Industrial 
              Revolution might deliver. </p>

        <p>Cyril Ramaphosa, the elected President of South Africa announced at his first State of The Nation Address 
            how the Fourth Industrial Revolution would be incorporated into his economic policy. Ramaphosa also announced a 
            Digital Industrial Revolution Commission to help his government take advantage of rapid technologies. </p>

        <p>South Africa is not, however, an obvious location for the Fourth Industrial Revolution to take place as the country’s 
            economy is deeply rooted in farming, mining and the informal sector. The country is also burdened with high levels of 
            unemployment whilst many citizens lack basic skills and education. The lack of interdepartmental coordination aggravated 
            by repeated ministerial reshuffles also results in a poor track record of the development and implementations of complex 
            policies which are required to successfully implement the Fourth Industrial Revolution. These challenges that South Africa 
            faces are the results of the country’s political and economic history. The paper goes on to review the role Africa played 
            in the previous three industrial revolutions, discuss the industry policy in South Africa and evaluate industrial 
            automation as a driver of change.</p>

        <h3>Industrial Revolutions  </h3>
        <p>Whilst there is much uncertainty about the actual existence of three distinct industrial revolutions, Economic History 
            realizes the first as a shift from rural-agrarian to urban-mechanized production, the second as the shift to mass production, 
            distribution and communication and the third as advances in computing and networks. </p>
   
   
        <p>The Fourth Industrial Revolution did not arise from the historical analyses of the previous revolutions but from a recent 
            tradition of business re-imagining themselves before their rivals in order to capture their revenues. This pursuit of strategic 
            re-invention involves the implementation of new technologies to help create and better understand the future. While in the past 
            the aim was to align ICT and business strategies, the new approach is to fuse the two together and approach them as a process 
            rather than an end state. </p>
   
        <p>This transformation involves the changing of business processes, machines and people. In Africa, Significant problems lie in the 
            lack of engagement of most governments with advanced technology compounded by their lack of capacity to manage investments and a
             slow administrative political process. While it is too soon to assess the overall effects the attempt to implement the Fourth 
             Industrial Revolution has had on countries in Africa, it is important to note that currently many of them suffer productivity 
             puzzles with sluggish rather than revolutionary rates of change.</p>

        <h3>Industry Policy in South Africa </h3>
        <p>Many of the industrial jobs in South Africa are a result of foreign direct investments into the automobile sector, with only a 
            small local network South Africa had to look to integration into global production networks. From the 1950s the National Party 
            attempted to use Black or Bantu labour, rather than capital, at artificially low wages and within strict geographical confine, 
            these policies, along with international sanctions against apartheid lead to many Multinational Corporations selling their 
            subsidiaries to local investors. When the National Party was no longer in power and these bans were lifted, The African National 
            Congress faced significant challenges in unwinding the ethically and geographically skewed development achieved by the National Party.  </p>

        <p>The manufacturers that had opened plants in South Africa returned in the 1990s to find an inefficient industry focused on domestic 
            sales. The aims of South African industrial policy have been to maintain and create jobs to support economic growth and while the 
            fourth industrial revolution does promise improvement in the manufacturing industry, the further automation of production could 
            see an increase in unemployment rates. The implementation of autonomous vehicle and the rise of transportation as a service could 
            also devastate vehicle demand.  </p>

        <h3>Industrial Automation  </h3>
        <p> Advancements in manufacturing today involve the use of computers, robots and software enabling the production of complex goods 
            on a massive scale. The Fourth Industrial revolution contains potentially useful policies to improve competitiveness of industry 
            but those less able to adapt could be left with an increase in social and territorial inequalities.  </p>

        <p>Robots are central to automation, extensively in the automobile industry, their supply is dominated by Asia with China supplying 40% 
            of the global market. Improvements in robot’s ability to grip, their mobility and vision have made them widely useful. Cloud robotics 
            also allows for improved performance and the processing and sharing of information between robots. Robots also allow mining firms to
             reduce their operating costs, to increase their efficiency and to access ores in deeper rocks and on the seabed. This reduces the 
             demand for unskilled labour and this automation of work and the potential loss of jobs are central concerns about the 
             Fourth Industrial Revolution.</p>

        <p>The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development suggests that this increase in unemployment is unlikely, finding only 9% of 
            jobs to be automatable, with less qualified workers bearing the brunt of the losses. While developing countries, like South Africa, 
            have previously seen their abundance of low-skilled labour as an advantage, it could now become a devastating liability. </p>

        <h3>Conclusion </h3>
        <p>Sutherland draws the conclusion that the Fourth Industrial Revolution is more a rhetorical device than an analytical device and that 
            instead of viewing the changes as a single industrial revolution, policy-makers should focus on particular technologies and skills 
            training. Viewed in this light, the challenges for the South African government become formidable but addressable. They must ensure 
            a sufficient supply of skills through education while retraining workers displaced by automation. Their approach has to be done in a 
            democratic way, with accountability and transparency. The paper ends with a call for further research to be done into understanding 
            the limitation of the South African government to develop and implement the policies necessary to boost its economy. </p>
