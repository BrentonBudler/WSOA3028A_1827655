                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p >The Relational Self-Portrait by Mark Graham and William H. Dutton is established on the basis that Social Network Sites, 
                    referred to throughout the paper as SNS, did not emerge by accident but instead evolved from two historical ideas. The first 
                    of these ideas is that a person can be signified by a static object or set of objects. This process of representing one’s self 
                    as an object began with the portrait. These were sculpted, painted and more recently taken as photograph and have been around 
                    since as early as ancient Egypt and China where portraits were used to memorialize the dead. Later, they were used around the world 
                    to valorise the esteemed and powerful. These portraits were decontextualizing selective representations of the self which were able to 
                    persist outside of the self but whose permanence was never guaranteed. </p>

                <p> Another significant personalizing technology appeared in the seventeenth century, the personal. A terse characterization of the self 
                    that made a person attract active to others whilst signifying what that individual was seeking in someone else.</p>

                <h3>Online Self-Portrait</h3>
                <p>The paper explains that the modern online profile is the natural evolution of these personalizing technology which combines elements 
                    from both of its predecessors. It draws parallels between the online “likes” and how people in portraits would wear clothing or accessories
                    which reflected their interests. It also notes how the information in personals was often false or misleading much like how individuals lie
                    on online dating sites to make themselves seem more attractive. The paper also explores another personalizing technology, the “homepage”,
                    a webpage which people could customize and host on other sites such as Geocities, Anglefire and Tripo. These homegpages eventually succumbed 
                    to the growing popularity of profiles which came at an expense of a free-for-all self-representation, because the database software being used 
                    for profiles was restricted by rows of well-formed data. 
                </p>

                <p> 
                    The second historical idea which SNS evolved from is that one can represent human relationships as discrete person-to-person connections.
                    These connections can easily be established using two sets of data, the first set is a list of people whilst the second set denotes the relationships 
                    between these people. Traditionally these relationships were formed by face-to-face interactions but the evolution of SNSs has allowed for them to 
                    become so much more. This evolution however does pose a new set of questions, should the relationships be directed or undirected? Should these 
                    relationships be binary or hold some sort of weighting depending on the type of relationship? The paper reflects on some of the research that has been 
                    done to answer these questions whilst simultaneously opening them up as avenues for further research.

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>The paper finishes by explaining that in order to combat the negative consequences that come from interacting using SNSs, we should embrace Networked 
                    Individualism. In other words, people need to operate as connected individuals rather than embedded group members, initiating and sustaining contact 
                    between people based on person-to-person contact regardless of whether such contact is physical or digital.
