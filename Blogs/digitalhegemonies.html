            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p >This blog post is a close reading of 
                <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/24694452.2017.1308240" style="color:white">“Digital Hegemonies: The Localness of Search Engine Results”.</a>
                The paper begins by explaining how the places we live in and the experiences we have with the world around us are becoming 
                increasingly digital and that these digital augmentations of places matter just as much as their material counterparts.
                These augmentations do not, however, represent anything new and tend to reinforce and legitimate the dominant and powerful. 
                Many had hoped that the internet as a technology would equalize the opportunity that people have to access and participate 
                regardless of their geographic placing, but these hopes have not been realized as confirmed by research into 
                <a href="informationgeographies.html" style="color:white">Information Geographies</a>
                This paper aims to explore how the geography of information integrates with search engines and focuses
                specifically on Google to examine whether it directs users to locally or nonlocally produced Web content.</p>

            <h3>Search Engines </h3>
            <p>Search engines are used by most people as a gateway to the world wide web. They direct a user to relevant information 
                and filter that information to distinguish between more and less useful content. This does however put them in a position 
                where they can decide what information becomes visible to whom resulting in an infrastructure with precise characteristics, 
                logics and biases. These search engines have developed a powerful influence on society. Content producers have realized this 
                power and witnessed the rise of SEO (Search Engine Optimization) which aims to reverse-engineer specific engines’ algorithms 
                to create web content which becomes more visible on those engines. This influential power was again manifested in the term 
                Search Engine Manipulation Effect (SEME) which explains bias search results’ ability to manipulate an individual’s political choices. </p>
    
    
            <p>These search engines also often personalize results based on a user’s personal profile. This personalization of results can lead 
                to the formation of a “filter bubble” in which a user is only exposed to content that matches their political and cultural inclinations. </p>
    
            <p>The paper does note that different search engines dominate large markets like Baidu in China, Yandex in Russia and Naver in South Korea 
                but justifies its use of Google for its analysis as it accounts for 54% of global searches. While this decision does make sense 
                from an implementation standpoint, as the same methodology can be applied across each country as Google is being used throughout, 
                it does come with the expense of potentially tainting results. In order for a fair analysis to be done, the dominant search engine 
                in each of the locations would have to be used as opposed to just Google. The information acquired from these search engines in the 
                analyses could be included along with the information acquired from Google which would not only create equity in the study but could 
                also provide interesting insight into the variances in search results depending on the search engine.</p>

            <h3>The Geography of Google Search Results </h3>
            <p>Searching for a location on Google will provide a user with a highly visible entry point to obtain information about the city’s 
                geography, economy, politics, history and culture. The results will differ depending on whether the user is using the local 
                version of Google for that location or whether they are using the U.S version. A setting also allows the user to either 
                include results from any country or from those exclusively generated from the country of the version they are using. 
                This setting does however default to allowing content from all countries and due to most users feeling comfortable with 
                the default settings of software, this is never changed. </p>

            <p> But just how much of the content that appears when searching for a location  is produced by people in that location and 
                how much is produced by people from other locations? Ballatore, Graham and Sen provide an outlined, in-depth methodology 
                for how they went about answering this question. </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Data Collection and Validation </h3>
            <p> The researchers started by collecting the search results for the capital cities of 188 countries. These searches were 
                repeated multiple time with the researchers altering different parameters each time, these parameters included the 
                country-specific version of the search engine, the desired language of results and the language which the search text 
                was written in. These parameters were passed to the search engine in the form of relevant and stable URLs. 
                The researchers recorded the results which appeared on the first page and repeated these searches four times over the 
                course of three months to account for varying results, particularly with respect to news stories. </p>

        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Geolocation of Web Pages</h3>
            <p>The next step required for the analysis was to accurately identify the geographic origin of each of the web pages which appeared 
                on the first page results of the searches above. They achieved this by using Sen’s geoprovenance inference 
                algorithm which uses five distinct signals to determine the country primarily responsible for publishing the 
                information on a webpage. These five signals include the administrative contact’s mailing address, any known organizational 
                headquarters associated with the page’s domain, specific country suffixes, geolocation of the server housing the URL 
                and the language of the page’s content. The researches then used the number of local results for a search and the number of 
                total results to determine the localness of Google Search Results. </p>
        
            <p> An incredibly important aspect of a webpage that is not included in the analysis is the date that a page was published. 
                Although the searches were repeated over the course of three months to account for news stories, there is no denying that 
                a specific event could trigger an overflow of web content being developed about a certain location. To demonstrate my point, 
                I will use the Chinese city of Wuhan. Of the ten first page results yielded by searching “Wuhan” on Google today, in 2020, 9 
                of the results have to do with the role the city played in the Coronavirus. However, if the same search was conducted 2 years 
                ago, the first page results would have been very different.  To further validify their data, the researchers would have to 
                look at the date on which pages where published and determine a time frame over which they want to perform their analysis. </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Localness of Google Search Results </h3>
            <p>The researchers then go on to explain the localness at a country level and analyze them using a country’s robustness of 
                digital infrastructure, education levels, language barriers and scholarly publishing. They also note that the role of 
                these explanatory variables does differ between the U.S and local datasets but that these four variables explain roughly 
                half of the variations in the localness of search results. </p>
            
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Conclusion </h3>
            <p>The investigation found that wealthy, well-connected countries tend to have much more locally produced content that is 
                visible to them than poor, disconnected countries regardless of the countries population. This gives rise to form of 
                Digital Hegemony whereby a few countries define what is read by others. In the results of sixty-one countries the 
                United States supplied over half of the first page content on Google. France also has a sphere of influence dominating 
                the production of search results for several African countries. .</p>
        
            <p>These results cause two major problems; countries in the Global South continue to be defined by bias sources in the Global 
                North and countries in the Global North have no exposure to geographic representations made by nonlocals. This is due to the 
                production of internet content happening at a slower rate in the Global South but also because Google’s algorithms tend to 
                favor web pages that are linked to by a lot of other web pages meaning information peripheries are unable to break out of 
                their digital marginality.</p>
        
            <p>The paper ends with a call for further research into why some parts of the world are denied locally produced representations 
                as well as how we might bring about more representative and participatory digital augmentation of place.</p>

            <h3>Reflection </h3>
            <p>Its always interesting for me to see how much time, energy and funding is being put into research that reaffirms the presence 
                of the distinct digital divides that exist in our society as opposed to research which could help mitigate these divides. 
                The inequalities which exist between the Global North and Global South as well as between individuals of different classes
                within countries around the word have been around for decades. They are deep-rooted in our globe's history and over the years
                so much research has been conducted to figure out how this has occurred and why it is relevant instead of finding ways to alleviate 
                it. In my blog post about these 
                <a href="inequalities.html" style="color:white">digital inequalities</a>, 
                I explore how these inequalities have even managed to seep through into 
                new emerging technology. I feel like this is just expanding on foundations that are already crumbling. I believe that if the 
                focus of the researchers as well as the companies funding this research shifted from an approach which attempts to answer 
                “why do these inequalities exist” to approach which sought answers for “how can we alleviate these inequalities and create equity” 
                the world we live in would be a very different place. </p>
