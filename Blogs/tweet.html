            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p >On the 20th of Feb 2020 Jeremy Howard tweeted “I’ve never seen anything quite like this”, “The creator of the YOLO algorithms had
                 stopped doing any computer vision research due to ethical concerns”, “This is huge”. If parts of that tweet or the entire thing 
                 left you scratching your head, hopefully this post will help you better understand the context and the situation at hand.  </p>

            <h3>What is the YOLO algorithm? </h3>
            <p>The YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm is an algorithm used in Object Detection software.
                <a href="https://medium.com/@ODSC/overview-of-the-yolo-object-detection-algorithm-7b52a745d3e0 " style="color:white">Object Detection</a>
                 is one of the classical problems in computer vision where you work to recoginize what and where. 
                The YOLO algorithm gets its name from the fact that unlike classification algorithms that select many different regions of an image to analyse,
                 it predicts classes and bounding boxes for the whole image in 
                 <a href="https://appsilon.com/object-detection-yolo-algorithm/ " style="color:white">one run of the algorithm</a>
                 allowing it to be substantially faster. The YOLO algorithm 
                 has been further developed to analyse video footage and find the objects in a video in

            <h3>Who is the creator of the YOLO algorithm?</h3>
            <p>Joseph Redmon is a Ph.D. student working alongside Allen School professor Ali Farhadi. He is a Computer Scientist who is renowned for his work in 
                <a href="https://news.cs.washington.edu/2018/04/05/allen-schools-joseph-redmon-wins-google-ph-d-fellowship/" style="color:white">Machine Learning and Computer Vision.</a>
                He is also internet-famous for his 
                <a href="https://pjreddie.com/static/Redmon%20Resume.pdf" style="color:white">resume.</a>
                Redmon graduated from the University of Washington and has worked on numerous 
                research papers. In 2018 he was awarded the Google Ph.D. fellowship for his work 
                in Machine Perception, Speed Technology and Computer Vision.</p>

            <h3>Why did Redmon say he would stop his research? </h3>
            <p>His announcement that he has ceased his research came about amongst a twitter feud between Roger Grosse, Assistant Professor of Computer Science 
                at the University of Toronto, and Maria Skoularidou, Probabilistic machine learning PhD student at the University of Cambridge. The feud followed 
                the announcement of a revised 
                <a href="https://syncedreview.com/2020/02/24/yolo-creator-says-he-stopped-cv-research-due-to-ethical-concerns/" style="color:white">NeurIPS 2020 paper submission guidelines.</a>
                The NeurIPS is a conference on 
                <a href="https://nips.cc/" style="color:white">Neral Information Processing Systems</a>
                and their revised 2020 guidelines stated that they now ask authors to add a 
                section on the broader impact of their work including possible
                <a href="https://medium.com/@NeurIPSConf/getting-started-with-neurips-2020-e350f9b39c28" style="color:white">societal consequences</a>
                The feud began when Skoularidou stated that these 
                considerations of broader impacts might help authors rethink whether 
                their work is worth submitting. Grosse then asked her for an example of 
                where Broader Impacts could result in an author not submitting their work.
                At which point Redmon stated that he had stopped his research into computer 
                vision as the related ethical issues had become

            <h3>Why would Redmond stop his research?</h3>
            <p>Redmon explains in his tweet the predominant reasons he has chosen to stop his work is due to the 
                military applications and privacy concerns. From a military application standpoint the consequences 
                of Redmond’s research could be devastating. It is no secret that there are an array of ethical concerns 
                that arise from Artificial Intelligence being incorporated into the field of warfare with research being 
                done into systems that could 
                <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Object-Recognition%2C-Tracking-and-Destruction-for-Gade-Wanare/5e6b7c4bd82d51aa555e29a2e4fa45b65ff86772" style="color:white">detect and track</a>
                intruding objects with one primary application being the tracking of illegal trespassers and border 
                encroachment by 
                <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050915030136" style="color:white">immigrants.</a>
                Whilst visual surveillance and tracking might not sound like something worth starting an ethical debate over, 
                this becomes a whole lot worse when the Object Detection software is used to identify a target for a lethal 
                attack by Autonomous Drone. </p>

            <p> 
                The other reason Redmon attributes to his discontinuation of Computer Vision research is privacy concerns. 
                Redmon’s research could be further developed into state-of-the-art facial recognition technology, an area many 
                people are uncomfortable with. These concerns are the result of 2 primary factors; Accuracy and Awareness. 
                Firstly, people are worried about the possibilities of inaccurate face detection, which could result in wrongful 
                identification or criminalisation. The other privacy concern is 
                <a href="https://www.securityinformed.com/insights/face-recognition-privacy-concerns-social-benefits-co-14319-ga.1585310302.html" style="color:white">awareness</a>
                , as the software would allow the user to 
                upload a picture of anyone regardless of whether or not that person knows about it. 
            </p>

            <p> 
                These are only some of the many ethical concerns that Artificial Intelligence as a whole and specifically Computer Vision have led to. 
                There are countless others, and the NeurIPS’s decision to make authors consider the broader applications of their work before publishing is a safety precaution
                 to prevent more of these ethical concerns to arise but whether or not this is reason for an expert in their field to completely cease research and development into a specific 
                 field remains debateable.
