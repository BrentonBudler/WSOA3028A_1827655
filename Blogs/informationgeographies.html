            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p >This blog post is a close reading of the paper
                <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281059919_Towards_a_Study_of_Information_Geographies_ImMutable_Augmentations_and_a_Mapping_of_the_Geographies_of_Information" style="color:white">
                “Towards a Study of Information Geographies: (Im)Mutable Augmentations and a Mapping of the Geographies of Information”</a>
                by Mark Graham, 
                Stefano De Sabba and Matthew Zook. The paper begins by exploring the idea that information 
                is not just an abstract concept that is unbounded to any physical entity but that the path 
                information travels and the mediums it travels through creates a material representation of 
                the information itself. This representation can also be tied to specific locations and when 
                this occurs, this information geography, becomes more than just representation of places but 
                part of the place itself and shapes how people view it. This places substantial value on 
                epistemic control as a manner of influence and power.</p>

            <h3>Pre-digital geographies of information </h3>
            <p>Before the information revolution, information was largely constrained in particular paper-based 
                physical forms, meaning information was both scarce and geographically embedded. Without access 
                to these forms, there was no access to the information itself. The need to manage and organize 
                this information into particular forms resulted in the formation of formalised education governed 
                by universities, associations and guilds. However these, once again, were concrete, geographic 
                locations which only a small amount of the global population, predominantly in the northern hemisphere, could access.</p>  

            <p>The importance of these formalized education institutions should not be undermined. The information 
                geographies that exist today, which are explored in the sections below, are largely due to these 
                pre-existing ones and it is important to analyse what the information technologies looked like before 
                the information revolution. According to the 
                <a href="https://historyoftechnologyif.weebly.com/information-age.html" style="color:white">History of Technology</a>
                the information revolution began around the 1970s. Research could be done into what information centers 
                existed at the time, where they were located and how they became to be. This insight would help establish 
                a starting point for our understanding of the information geography that existed before the technological revolution.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>Changing geographies after the information revolution</h3>
            <p>After the information revolution many of the barriers restricting information had been greatly reduced due to a 
                higher accessibility to computers that can readily receive and transmit information non-proximately. Whilst this 
                new era included the loss of pre-digital traditional mediators, which some found unsettling, most embrace the 
                freedom and abilities this brings. The questions that arises is whether or not this changed the political economy 
                or geography of information? Even though people can theoretically access information, does this necessarily mean there 
                have been changes in geographies of participation and representation.</p>

            <p> This paper answers these questions by using global analysis of three distinct geographies and comparing their 
                prevalence in different countries. Whilst this is effective in providing a representation of the information 
                geography that exists today the question is whether or not this has changed the information geography, again 
                highlighting the necessity for an analysis of the information geographies, that existed before the information 
                revolution happened. Furthermore, the inclusion of an analysis of what role different countries played in the 
                information revolution itself is imperative in understanding why there are such evident discrepancies in different 
                countries’ ability to access and engage with information, specifically online.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>Geography of Access and Enablement </h3>
            <p> The prerequisite for most digital engagement is internet access. Using data acquired from the World Bank, numerous 
                conclusions can be drawn about global internet access. Firstly, it is evident that the discrepancies that appear in 
                the pre-digital information geographies are still present, with countries like China, the United States of America, 
                India and Japan having the highest internet populations and over 20 sub-Saharan African countries having an internet 
                penetration of less than 10%. This divide is articulated even further when looking at broadband affordability. Europe 
                and North America have some of the lowest relative costs in the world, whilst in Africa the cost ranges between 10% 
                and 250% of average income. Even though this issue has more to do with the low average incomes in Africa rather than 
                high broadband costs it still contributes largely to the information geography.</p>

            <p> The analysis done here is exceptionally broad and although the authors do acknowledge this, it is still important to note. 
                The factors that influence internet access cannot simply be analysed using people’s ability to afford broadband connectivity, 
                the analysis completely disregards the fact that in order to access the internet you need a device that can establish an 
                internet connection. For instance, in Africa, whilst people might be able to afford broadband and have an internet connection, 
                according to 
                <a href="https://www.gsma.com/mobilefordevelopment/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GSMA-State-of-Mobile-Internet-Connectivity-Report-2019.pdf" style="color:white">GSMA</a>
                only 45% of people own a mobile device and 
                <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/748549/africa-households-with-computer/" style="color:white">Statistica</a>
                states that less than 11% have a computer at home. This unequitable access to computing devices should also be included to 
                establish a more accurate representation of access and enablement.</p>

            <h3>  Geography of participation</h3>
            <p>The geography of participation is analysed using three different variables: Domain names (produced content), Github Users 
                (contributors to open software) and Wikipedia Edits (contributions to open encyclopaedia). The analysis of domain names 
                found that large internet populations do not automatically translate into large numbers of domain registrations, meaning 
                there is a large difference between access to information and participating in its creation and distribution with Western 
                Europe and North America producing most of the world’s digital content. These disproportionalities are once again highlighted 
                when looking at the number of Github users, Europe and North America are significantly more involved in collaborative code 
                development than any other part of the world, including the Middle East which contains a considerably lower number of user 
                than would be expected given their level of internet access. Even though Wikipedia supports over 282 languages, stark inequalities 
                were once again apparent when analysing the number of edits with over a million edits each quarter coming from users located in 
                the United States and Europe and only a few thousand coming from Africa and the Middle East. </p>
        
            <p> Whilst using Domain Names, Github Users and Wikipedia Edits does help form a basic idea of online participation, there is 
                one extremely important contributing factor to participation has been excluded; Social Media. People are far more likely to 
                produce content for Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube than they are to create a domain or edit a Wikipedia page. 
                <a href="https://www.brandwatch.com/blog/amazing-social-media-statistics-and-facts/" style="color:white">Brandwatch.com</a> states that there are more 
                than 3.75 billion active social media users and omitting them from an analysis of online participation greatly undermines 
                the validity of the results.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>  Geographies of representation</h3>
            <p>The geography of representation is analysed using a series of different digital representations. The first of these 
                representations is Google Searches; the number of retrieved pages mentioning a country when it is searched on Google 
                and although Google indexes a large number of pages about even the smallest and most sparsely populated territories it 
                also reflects the broader uneven information inequalities that make up the web. The next of these representations is the 
                number of elements used to represent any point feature (nodes) in a country on OSM (OpenStreetMap), the world’s largest 
                roadmap. Unsurprisingly the United States accounted for the largest number of content with California alone accounting for 
                as much content as the entire continent of Africa.</p>
            
            <p>The final representations are Freebase and Geonames, two of the most important back-end databases being used to create a 
                semantic web. Again, the United States had the largest concentration on Freebase, with 45% of the placenames on the database 
                even though it contains less than 5% of the world’s population. On Geonames the United States also had more content than all 
                of Asia. Although each platform has its own idiosyncrasies, it is evident that North America and Europe are overrepresented 
                and the rest of the world is severely under-represented.  </p>

            <p>Up until this point a large emphasis has been put on the apparent discrepancies in internet access and engagement between 
                the northern and southern hemisphere. This analysis of the geography of representation highlights another stark contrast 
                that exists; the one between the western and eastern hemisphere. Although the Middle East has such a high internet population 
                density, these numbers do not translate into an equal online representation. Emphasis on this disparity and further research 
                into what causes it would allow for more well-rounded conclusions to be drawn about the current information geography that 
                exists globally.</p>

            <h3>  Conclusion </h3>
            <p>The primary conclusion the paper draws is that there obvious divide in information geographies that existed between 
                north and south in the pre-digital age have transcended and been elevated by the information revolution rather than 
                alleviated. It calls for immediate action for drastic changes to be made in order to change these stubborn differences. 
                This is where the most vital avenue of future research opens up; what can be done in order to bridge the ever expanding 
                digital divide to create a synchronous equitable global information geography. Empirical research needs to be done to 
                determine exactly how the United States and Europe came to be the world leaders in internet accessibility, participation 
                and representation. A bespoke methodical approach needs to be developed for each country that can be implemented over-time 
                to reach a position where they are able to engage with the internet equally because just as Google’s core mission states 
                the goal is to “organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful”.</p>
