            <h3>Reflections on readings</h3>
            <p >At first the concept explored in the Library of Babel is rather difficult to wrap your head around. 
            As humans we struggle to conceptualize exactly how big infinity is. But as you come to terms with the 
            fact that in an infinitely large library of books with infinite iterations of randomly ordered letters
            there could be very well be a book that contains your name; and even your whole life story. I think 
            parallels can be drawn between this and the almost infinite size of the internet. The fact that Borges 
            was already envisioning the idea of such a large, interconnected center of information in the year 1944 
            shows that the idea of something like the internet was present in human consciousness long before technology caught up to it. 
            </p>

            <p> In the Garden of Forking Paths I think the primary take away is the idea of Ts’ui Pen’s novel (and Garden) 
            branching out into new multiple narrative universes how similar that process is to clicking a link on a webpage 
            that takes you to another, and then another and again to a new webpage. I think if you had to retrace your steps 
            you’d realize the “Paths” we follow on the internet as we browse it are similar to the Paths in the Garden. 
            </p>

            <p>Lastly in As We May Think, it is scary how similar Vannevar Bush’s idea of a memex is to what we call the internet 
            today. Although Bush envisioned the information to be stored using ultra high resolution micro-film reels and not 
            servers like it actually is today. He was able to foresee the creation of some sort of collective memory machine where 
            information is easily accessible which is essentially what the internet has become.
