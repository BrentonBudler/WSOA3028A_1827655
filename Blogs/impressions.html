            <h3>Description of Character</h3>
            <p>
                My character is Kent Wilson, a 26 year old with a passion for fitness and nutrition. Kent has a BSc in Sports 
                Sciences from The University of Pretoria and has also done an online Nutrition course. He lives with his fiancé 
                Robin Smith. His website is a portfolio page for himself but also a platform on which he shares interesting articles about training and dieting for others to read.

            <h3>Character About</h3>
            <p >My whole life started when I was born in Johannesburg at Olivedale Clinic on the 28th of September 1995. 
                I attend Randpark Primary school but moved to King Edwards School at the beginning of grade 8. Growing up I was 
                never the most well-built. In my primary school phase I was a bit over weight and often got bullied for the way 
                that I look. At a young age I decided to change that so I began learning about exercising and eating healthier, 
                by the time I reached grade I had lost a lot of weight so feeling good about myself I went to the first day of my 
                new school, unfortunately this wasn’t much better. Now I was being ridiculed for being too skinny and was never 
                chosen for the rugby team because I did not have any muscle mass. This is when I began my journey into learning 
                about muscle development and what I needed to do to gain more muscle. After hours of research, training and cooking 
                meals of the course of 4 years, I had finally reached  a point where I was not only happy with the way I looked but 
                it also boosted my self-confidence and I was able to play first team rugby in my Grade 12 year. </p>
    
            <p> After school I decided to get a formal education in the fitness field, I had fallen in love with, so I got my BSc in 
                Sport Sciences from the University of Pretoria. Along the way I was lucky enough to work with professional athletes like 
                Siya Kolisi, William Bonac and Caster Semenya to mention a few.</p>
    
            <p>
                Now my life’s journey is to help people who are unhappy with the way they look completely transform themselves 
                through tailor-made training protocols and bespoke diets so that they too can feel the lifestyle and attitude 
                change that comes with a well-built physique. Furthermore, I want to help athletes become the best version of themselves 
                regardless of what their goals are and to educate people as to why certain approaches work instead just telling them what to do.

            <h3>Why I chose this Character</h3>
            <p>
               I have been going to the gym and training for a few years now. In my first year of training I was bombarded by these self-proclaimed
               "fitness-experts" who wanted me to sign up for the latest program or try this and that supplement. In actual fact these "experts" were 
               just steroid-junkies who needed the money from their clients to fund thier unhealthy lifestyle. After working with one or two of these 
               "experts" I finally found an actual qualified trainer and dietician to work with. I was amazed by how much of the information I was taught 
               prior to that had been absolute nonsense and how much time I had wasted trying diet fads or supplements that were recommended to me. 
            I wouldn't want young people who are passionate about fitness to fall into the same trap I did. I chose Kent as my character because he is 
            exactly the person I wish I had to guide and mentor me when I first started training. Someone who actually knows what they're doing and wants to
            help others on their fitness journies.
