        <h3>What interactivity means on the www</h3>
        <p >By definition, interactivity is the communication process that takes place between humans and 
            computer software(technopedia.com). With regards to the World Wide Web, Web Browsers(explored in 
            my blog “Technologies behind the World Wide Web”), serve as a platform for an array of interactions 
            between the user and the web. The various input and output elements on a device bridge this gap between 
            the user and the webpage they are interacting with and are explored further later in the next section of t
            he blog. Hypertext (also explored in “Technologies behind the World Wide Web”) is another element that allows 
            for unique interactions on the web, their interconnectivity creates a sense of endless wonder which the user, 
            through interacting with them, can explore. </p>

        <h3>Events and interactivity</h3>
        <p> The process in which a user provides some sort of input and then receives a resulting output is essentially 
            what forms the base of interactivity on the web. I think, as a web developer, it is important to explore these 
            available forms of input and output to ensure that when a web page is developed these are all taken into consideration 
            to create meaningful, useful interactions between the user and the web. </p>

        <p>The primary sources of input for interactivity are of course the keyboard and mouse (or some form of track pad), 
            these two alone allow for a large variety of communication techniques to be implemented into the websites we create. 
            From typing commands to clicking on elements on the webpage, the possibilities are endless. Mobile browsers also bring 
            a whole new form of interactivity, as their screens serve as both their mouse and keyboard simultaneously, the touch screen 
            also allows for unique inputs such as drawing lines or pressing multiple points on the screen simultaneously.</p>

        <p>The screens and speakers most devices are fitted with also allow for a variety of outputs to be incorporated into the webpage. 
            From images and videos to notification sounds and pop-ups, the possibility for the type of event that results from an input 
            are essentially endless.</p>

        <p>I think the incorporation of these events and interactivity are crucially important not only to present the information on a 
            webpage in a clear, readable way but also to ensure the user remains engaged with the webpage and develops a good relationship 
            with the website, so they are more likely to visit it again.</p>

        <h3>Hypertext, navigation and structure</h3>
        <p>In “The Hyperlink as an organizing principle” , Halvais explains that hyperlinks and viewing them within a larger networked 
            structure reflects deep social and cultural structures. When looking at how we structure the use of hyperlinks to form navigation 
            within a website, I think it is important to look at the roles that the society we live in and the cultures we grew up in effect 
            the way we process information. Topano & Roberto state in their work “Semiotic Design and Analysis of Hypermedia” that one of the 
            core principles of their proposed framework is a narrative approach and that even at a young age, humans are exposed to narratives 
            as a form of knowledge. I think this is crucially important and must be taken into account when developing a navigation system as 
            it should flow from one point to another in a logical, progressive way, almost like a story, to ensure the user is able to consume 
            all the presented information systematically and that it does not become overwhelming.

        <h3> A reflection on the metaphors we use to understand digital information</h3>
        <p> The technology we use today developed at such a fast pace and most people don’t have the expertise to explain how they work on 
            a technical level so it is only natural for us, as humans, to equate the unknown with something we’re familiar with so that we’re 
            able to understand it a bit better. I think this holds true for so much of the digital content we deal with every day. The way we 
            store information on our computers as “Folders” and “Files”, just like they were stored physically before the technological 
            revolution is just a metaphor for the clusters of data stored on the hard drive. Our “Desktop” where we save things we want to 
            access quickly, just like physical documents that still needed to be processed are stored on an actual desk. There are so many 
            examples like this, but I think the most interesting of these examples start to appear when looking at the World Wide Web. Just in 
            the name itself, we view its interconnectivity as a Web like the one a spider would weave, with each piece being a link from one page 
            to another when in actual fact these are just bundles of data being stored on different servers and accessed from different locations. 
            And even within that explanation of the Web metaphor I used the word “Page” which in itself is another metaphor, as the webpages we 
            view online are not actual pages but are represented as such because they present images, text and other information just like 
            physically printed pages do.</p>
        
        <p>I think the primary reason these metaphors are used, as mentioned earlier, is for the public to have a general understanding of 
            how these things work but I believe as a web developer it is important to know what these things actually represented and how they 
            work on a technical level. </p>
