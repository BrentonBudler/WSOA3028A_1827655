            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p >This post is a reflection on “Digital Inequalities in the age of Artificial Intelligence and big data” by
                 Christoph Lutz how these inequalities relate to a South African Context  Lutz’s paper serves predominantly 
                 as a platform to reflect on what research into digital inequalities had been done, the results this research yielded, 
                 and what research needs to be done into this field as new technologies begin to emerge. The paper begins by outlining 
                 exactly what digital inequalities are, explaining that they were initially described as “disparities in the structure 
                 and of access to and use of ICT” which tend to mirror existing social inequalities but have developed over the passed 
                 two decades to include much more than that. Lutz uses a three-level approach to describe what digital inequalities have 
                 developed into. </p>

            <h3>Unequal Internet Access</h3>
            <p>The first of these levels describes the unequal access to the internet which entails more than just the binary options of 
                access or no access but a more complex explanation of different technologies and how the way these technologies access the 
                internet are restricted in some way. For instance, mobile internet access offers lower functionality in terms of speed,
                 memory and storage space but also includes limited content availability as traditional websites often lack a mobile-friendly 
                 version and even those that are mobile-friendly often have to omit certain information from the website for this to be possible. 
                 These restrictions are even further amplified in emerging technologies such as smart homes and smart speakers as they are mostly 
                 restricted to voice-based interactions and the software they use only pulls content from a few resources. Furthermore, these voice-based 
                 interactions widen the pre-existing digital divides as the software struggles to understand particular accents and dialects. Lutz calls 
                 for further digital inequities research to systematically assess content availability for each of these systems and studying potential access gaps.
            </p>


            <p> 
                When analysing digital inequalities in a South African context, this first level of is by far the most predominant. According to 
                <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/south-africa-population/) " style="color:white">Worldometers</a>
                the current population of South Africa is 59 235 276 whilst 
                <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/685134/south-africa-digital-population/) " style="color:white">Statisca</a>
                found that the current number of internet users in South Africa is 36 540 000. Meaning more than 38% of the country does not have any 
                access to the internet. This extreme digital inequality becomes even more evident when analysing the type of internet access. Of the 36 540 00 
                people with internet access, 34 930 000 of them access the internet using a mobile device, meaning 96% of internet access in South Africa is 
                restricted by the functional and content limitations placed on mobile devices.

            <h3>Skills and Usesr</h3>
            <p>
                The second of these digital divide levels explores the disparities present in skills and uses of the internet showing how age, gender and 
                education and other contributing factors have a substantial effect on an individual’s ability to access and interact with the internet. With digital 
                forms of work becoming more common than ever, the inability to efficiently use the internet greatly depreciates an individual’s likelihood of finding work, 
                further widening the digital divide.  Lutz suggests that further research should be done into not only who is using the internet to earn money but also into 
                the emerging hierarchies in the digital economy.
            </p>

            <p> 
                South Africa has an interesting demographic when it comes to ability to use the internet. This is largely due to the socio-economic divides that exist in our country.
                 In rural areas, most schools do not have the resources to teach their students how to use the internet, and most people living in those areas have no access to technology, 
                 or to an institution that could educate them on how to use the internet efficiently. A compilation of data in an article written for the 
                 <a href="https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2020-03-26-bridging-the-digital-divide-is-crucial-in-the-battle-against-covid-19/ " style="color:white">Daily Maveric</a>
                 found that of all the internet users in south Africa, 66% of them had a secondary education or higher, a privilege that a lot of South Africans are unable to afford. Due to 
                 our country’s history and long-standing battle with inequalities amongst different races, another digital divide is evident. 64% of internet users in South Africa are white, 
                 whilst 24% are black, 7% are coloured and 5% are Indian.

            <h3>Gains from Internet Usage</h3>
            <p>
                The final level in Lutz’s explanation of digital divides refers to differences in gains from internet use, in other words an individual’s capacity to translate their internet 
                access into favourable offline outcomes. This ability and the resulting outcomes exacerbate existing social inequalities and can be described as a Matthew effect as the rich 
                get richer and use technology to strengthen their position in society. This third level also includes people’s representation online as in a world where surveillance is predominantly 
                being done using digital traces, people without any online representation will result in Artificial Intelligence with data driven algorithms reinforcing established structural inequalities. 
                Lutz explains that further research into this third level should include data-based discrimination, digital traces and algorithmic surveillance into its scope.
            </p>

            <p>
                Learning new information , developing new skills and contacting family and friends are just some of the real life benefits internet users can experience, but is this what South Africans 
                are using the internet for? Well, no. According to digital statistics gathered by 
                <a href="https://qwertydigital.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Digital-Statistics-in-South-Africa-2017-Report.pdf " style="color:white">Qwerty</a>
                in 2017, 70% of our weekly online activities are spent on Social Media Platforms. And whilst some may argue that social media platforms are a method of acquiring information for the most 
                part this does not contribute to our ability to translate internet access into offline favourable outcomes. This does however mean that of the people using the internet, most of them have 
                some sort of internet representation in the form of social media accounts meaning digital traces can be used along with artificial intelligence to analyse the internet population.

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
                Lutz concludes the paper by summarizing each level and what further research should be done into that level, once again reinforcing the importance of ensuring research into digital
                 inequalities and how they can be alleviated should be of the utmost importance when exploring emerging technologies rather than an afterthought or something that is excluded entirely.

            <h3>What does this mean for the country as a whole and me as an individual?</h3>
            <p>
                For me personally, I am privileged enough to have access to the internet, a good understanding of how it works and how to interact with it. This does however come with a certain amount of 
                responsibility, as I need to ensure that I use the internet for self-development and not waste the opportunity I have been given. It also means that I need to play my part is passing this
                 information onto others, teaching people without the understanding that I have how to use the internet and what they can do with it . 
            </p>

            <p>
                The digital inequalities that exist in South Africa as a whole are reinforcing the socio-economic divides that exist in our country. Technology and internet access have to start being used 
                as a tool to reduce poverty and increase everyone’s quality of life rather than a contributor to these divides. I think the only way these divides can be reduced is by focusing our attention 
                on educating those without and understanding and investing in infrastructure that allows equitable access rather than focusing on how the already educated can utilize the internet for their 
                own further personal gain.
