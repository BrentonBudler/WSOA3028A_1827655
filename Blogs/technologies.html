        <h3>Semantic Markup - What is it and Why is it necessary</h3>
        <p >Semantic mark-up is a way of structuring HTML code to ensure things are being used in the way 
            that they were intended to be used. While this may sound redundant it is incredibly important 
            when looking at web development because while two web pages may look similar, the way in which 
            the HTML code that controls the website has been put together can vary and these variations can 
            cause issues in the way that the website is accessed by different people. Not only people though, 
            when Web Robots crawl through the website to analyse what the site contains, semantic mark-up dictates 
            whether or not these Bots acquire and relay the correct information.</p>

        <h3>What is a browser? How do they work?</h3>
        <p>A browser is a software application that acts as a client in a client-server model with the Web acting as the server.
         The browser requests some sort of information from the Web server and the server sends this information back to the browser 
         where it is displayed on the computer. Through this process browsers are able to retrieve Web Pages, images, video and many 
         other files and display them accordingly. </p>

        <h3>What are URLs and how do they work?</h3>
        <p>Universal Resource Locator (URL) is the text that a user types into their browser in order to reach a webpage. Webpages 
            themselves are found using an Internet Protocol (IP) address which is a series of numbers. These series of numbers are 
            often long and complicated and would be impossible to remember so instead we use URL’s which our browser translates into 
            the IP for us using a Domain Name Server (DNS). That IP is then used to bring the user to their destination.</p>

        <h3>A reflection on McLuhan, M. ‘The Medium is the Message’</h3>
        <p>  McLuhan’s philosophy of “The Medium is the Message” has sparked many debates over the years. It essentially explains 
            that the medium a message is delivered through has a more profound effect on society than the message itself. At face 
            value this is a rather difficult thing to understand but once you start looking at examples the explanation becomes 
            evident. For instance, the creation of the television changed the way people arranged their houses more than any 
            television program ever could. Another prevalent example is Youtube, one has to think what has had a greater impact 
            on the billions of viewers on Youtube, the actual content on Youtube or the fact that the platform actually exists? 
            Although McLuhan died in 1980 and would never have seen the Internet we have today, it’s interesting to apply his 
            ideology to newer technologies to analyse how these technologies have shaped the way that we think. Looking at mobile 
            devices and social media, it is clear to see that this has completely shifted the way we interact with one another 
            socially more the content on the various social medias themselves ever could. And how having so much information available 
            at our fingertips has changed the way and speed at which we learn. Scholars around the world can write entire research papers 
            by only having to access the internet instead of having to go to a physical library.</p>

        <h3>  A reflection on Wardrip-Fruin, N. ‘What Hypertext Is’ </h3>
        <p>What Hypertext Is gives us unique insight into how various respected scholars define what hypertext is and then goes 
            on to explore what it was originally intended to be when it was defined by Theodor Holm Nelson, in its early stages of 
            development. Nelson initially defines hypertext as a body of written or pictorial material interconnect in a way that 
            could not be presented on paper, allowing some sort of exclusivity and advantage to those using the web, an experience 
            that could not be matched on paper. Nelson also goes on to explain that this interconnected phenomenon branches further 
            than just text with the introduction of hypermedia. It’s interesting to see how insistent he is on hypermedia being more 
            of a art form that is “designed, written, drawn and edited” rather than just something that is programmed by computer 
            professionals. </p>
