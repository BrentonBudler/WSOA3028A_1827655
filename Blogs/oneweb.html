        <h3>The uses of Metadata - what, why and how</h3>
        <p >Metadata is any auxiliary important information about a webpage that is not displayed on 
            the webpage but is used by search engines and browsers to determine how the webpage appears 
            in search results and how the data of the webpage is displayed. Examples of metadata include; 
            the webpage’s author, when last the page was modified or even a brief description of what the page contains. </p>

        <h3>Reflection on, a brief history of Web Robots</h3>
        <p>   The World Wide Web is an immense source of knowledge with almost infinite different webpages. 
            It would be impossible for any human, or even group of humans to transverse it all and analyse every 
            single page but somehow search engines are still able to provide you with links to website containing 
            exactly the key words and information you are looking for, how is this possible? Introducing Web Robots, 
            small software programs that have been coded to move from one webpage to another as they perform an array of 
            pre-programmed tasks. Not only do these Web Robots (or “Bots”) save an unimaginable amount of time, they are also 
            less likely to make mistakes than a human completing the same tasks would be. These Bots do however pose their own 
            unique threats. Just as it is possible to program them to complete some useful task it is also possible to program 
            malicious Bots that scour the web testing webpages security and try to cause havoc. Whilst Bots have a number of both 
            pros and cons I think it is important as web developers to take both of these into account and follow best practices 
            to ensure we create web pages that make the most of Bots functionality without becoming vulnerable to the potential 
            damage that can be cause by malicious bots. </p>

        <h3>The importance of Accessibility</h3>
        <p>As a society, the internet has become an integral part of our lives and has completely transformed the way we do 
            things. From the way we communicate, the way we learn and even the way we shop. As web developers it important to 
            remember that some users of the internet may have disabilities and that these disabilities should be taken into account
             when creating webpages. Webpages should allow for these people to interact with the site as easily as any other person 
             would. The importance of ensuring accessibility for all lies in the  core motivation for the creation of the World Wide 
             Web as a platform that is free for any and all to use. By ensuring webpages are usable by all, we ensure that as many 
             people are included in the Web experience as possible.  </p>

        <h3> Accessibility tools</h3>
        <p>  There are a wide variety of accessibility tools that have already been developed, from programs that will read out the 
            content of a webpage for visually impaired users, to assistive technologies that can be linked to a computer and allow 
            physically disabled users to engage with the internet without the use of a traditional keyboard and mouse. As developers, 
            it is our responsibility to ensure that we take every possible measure to ensure the web pages we create are accessible to 
            all. This includes everything from our choice of text style and size, to ensuring we include the necessary information so 
            that a screen reader can explain the site in the best way possible. Other useful tools include; ensuring that forms have 
            rigorous exception handling capabilities and that the information that needs to be filled in has an accurate description, 
            ensuring motion is minimized and including that there is an option to switch animations on a page off. By taking the necessary 
            precautions I believe webpages can be created for all people to enjoy regardless of who they are or what disability they have. </p>

        <h3> How does the Medium is the Message impact our understanding of the web? </h3>
        <p>As explored in last week’s blog post, the philosophy behind the Medium is the Message is essentially the fact that the 
            medium through which a message is delivered can have a more profound effect on us than the message itself. This ideology 
            impacts our understanding of the web because it allows us to explore how the existence of the web has affected us as 
            individuals as well as the way that we think.  Our thought process has become one that resembles the web, just as we move 
            from one page to another through hyperlinks our brains have been programmed to think in a pragmatical interconnected way in 
            which our ability to associate related material has become pronounced. We have also developed into being able to absorb and 
            process information a lot faster because it is presented to us quickly and continuously through RSS feeds and various forms of 
            social media.  It is important to note these developmental changes and identify that at their root they were motivated by the 
            medium of the Web rather than the content on it.
