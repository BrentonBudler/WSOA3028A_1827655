        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>The original creative vision I had for Kent Wilson’s Portfolio Website included an events page where users would be able to view 
            upcoming fitness-related events. Upon further reflection on the characters primary goal; to improve people’s quality of life, 
            I decided to extrapolate this events page idea into the unique platform Fitness in the City. The purpose of the platform is to 
            support people who would like to live a healthier lifestyle. It allows them to view gyms, healthy restaurants, upcoming running 
            races and fitness-related events located in and around the Johannesburg area. The incorporation of this page into the website 
            has the end-goal of improving user traffic on the site and through that, hopefully, boosting the number of people who reach out 
            to Kent to become his clients. The hypothetical time in which Kent would have launched this website would be around the beginning 
            of 2019, this would allow for him to maximize the number of clients he acquired as the beginning of the year always contains an 
            inflated amount of people looking to improve their fitness and quality of life as one of their New Year’s resolutions. </p>

        <h3>External Dependency </h3>
        <p>The external dependency I used to develop Fitness in the City is 
            <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/" style="color:white">Mapbox</a>.
             Mapbox is an open source mapping 
            platform for custom designed maps which allows the integration of location into any mobile or web application. The other alternative 
            for incorporating location into the website would be Google Maps. I chose Mapbox over Google Maps because of Mapbox’s ability to fully 
            customize the way your map looks. There is also a large amount of support documentation for the Mapbox API’s and SDK’s which allowed me 
            to learn how to manipulate the data displayed on the map using JavaScript and style the way the information on the map appeared using CSS.</p>

        <h3>Map Creation </h3>
        <p>The first step in developing Fitness in the City was creating a custom map using Mapbox Studio. I wanted the style of Fitness in the City 
            to match the style of the rest of the website so that the user experienced it as an integrated part of the website rather than a separate 
            entity which was loosely linked to the website. To achieve this, I used the same colour scheme of Black, White and Dodgerblue. The map’s 
            background was made black, the text and icons were made white and the roads where made dodgerblue. The base map provided by Mapbox Studio 
            has a lot of built-in content which makes the map rather overwhelming. The website however has a relatively minimalistic finish without too 
            much clutter or unnecessary elements. In order to further solidify the visual link between the main website and the Fitness in the City page, 
            I further manipulated some of the built-in components of Mapbox. First, I reduced the size of area and road names, I also changed the opacity 
            of the labels for settlement-subdivisions to be zero, leaving only the names of main areas visible. I also removed the text effects on the Point 
            of Interest labels to simplify their look. Lastly, I removed any unnecessary administrative boundary and transit labels. The final product was a 
            Map Style which matched the website’s style and was no longer overwhelming. </p>

        <h3>Incorporating Map  </h3>
        <p>Once the map style was created, I needed to link the map with the HTML page featured on the website. This was done by first importing the Mapbox 
            API and default style and then creating the map using JavaScript linked to a div HTML element which serves as the container for the map. 
            The map’s parameters also needed to be manipulated to ensure that Johannesburg was the center of the map and that the default zoom level allowed 
            the user to see the whole of Johannesburg as well as its surrounding areas. I also needed to set the bounds of the map so that the user’s ability 
            to pan was restricted to a certain area. </p>

        <h3>Populating Map </h3>
        <p>With the map created, I now had to add the actual content for the platform. The content would be added as layers of different icons which the user 
            could click, causing a pop-up to appear containing an image and hyperlink to a website containing more information about the location or event. 
            A source was created to store each collection’s information (Events, Restaurants, Runs and Gyms). Each of these collections stored a number of 
            features which would be the individual elements the map contained. Each feature stored the HTML code necessary to create the pop-up, the icon that 
            would appear on the map as well as the co-ordinates of where on the map the icon would appear. </p>
        
        <p>A layer was then created for each corresponding source, the layout parameters of the layer allowed for the icon size and image to be set, the Maki
             Icon pack was used for the different icons. A function that would be called when an icon on the respective layer was clicked was then created, this 
             function would convert the coordinates provided in the source to the lngLat format used by Mapbox and then create a popup, within a predefined offset, 
             above the given coordinates using the given HTML to determine its content. </p>
        
        <p>Functions that would be called when the mouse entered and exited the different icons were also added to turn the default hand into a pointer when 
            hovering over an icon. To give the user the ability to toggle which layers were visible and which were hidden, a variable which stored each of 
            the Layer’s ID’s was created. A loop would then iterate through each layer ID and create an HTML link element. When this link element was clicked, 
            a new variable would store the link’s corresponding Layer ID. A conditional statement would then check if the layer was already hidden and if it was, 
            would show it and add “active” to the layer’s class names. If the layer was already being shown, clicking the link would hide it , clear all its 
            corresponding icons, and clear its class names. Finally, a control which allows the user to see their location on the map, given that they fall 
            within the bounds, as well as onscreen navigation controls, were added to the map. All of this code was nested in a function which would be called 
            when the pages was loaded.</p>

        <h3>Styling</h3>
        <p>As mentioned above, Mapbox allows for its components to be styled using CSS. Which meant the font and color scheme used for the rest of the website 
            could also be incorporated into the popups and the links which toggle the layers. Adding a header to the page which matched the header used on the 
            website also allowed for further visual integration of the Fitness in the City page with the website. Further CSS code was also added to ensure this 
            header would be responsive and that the pop-ups would rescale themselves once a certain screen width was reached.</p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>The Fitness in the City platform currently only features a limited amount of locations and events for each category but once launched and as the 
            platform grew, new locations and events could be added. If there is one thing writing my blogs on Information Geography and the Localness of Google 
            Search Results taught me it is that there is a great deal of importance placed on the digital representations of places meaning the ability to feature 
            new places and events on the platform could even create a new business initiative for Kent in which companies pay him to be featured on the platform. </p>
