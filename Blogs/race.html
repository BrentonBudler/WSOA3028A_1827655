        <h3>Love, Challenge and Hope</h3>
        <p>In the interview with Ruha Benjamin, “Love, Challenge and Hope: Building a Movement to Dismantle a New Jim Code” Benjamin 
            explains that her mission is to raise awareness about the socio-political ideologies which influence technology. She explains 
            that authors and designers of technology need to consider the decisions they make when developing technology to ensure it is 
            not racist. She explains that this racism is not necessarily the overt racism in which a person has malicious intent but stems 
            from more the unintentional inconsideration which lead to engineering inequities and discriminatory designs.</p>

        <p>Benjamin proceeds to give examples of where post intentional analyses of different systems have revealed that instead of progressing 
            society into technological benevolence, these systems have allowed for the reinforcing and deepening of societal inequalities. 
            The first of these examples is a hand-sanitizer dispenser which two friends attempted to use; soap was only dispensed when the friend 
            with a lighter skin tone placed their hand under the sensor. Benjamin explains that this is a rather small scale, low stake occurrence 
            but that it holds lessons for much broader systems.  </p>


        <p>
            The second example Benjamin gives is of a Health Care AI system which identified patient who were predicted to get sicker and allowed
             healthcare experts to intervene at an earlier stage. The algorithm that was used for these predictions assumed that people who had spent 
             more money on healthcare in the past would need more help in the future. This system neglected the fact that people with insurance and 
             medical aid would be able to spend more and that Health Care system does not necessarily spend money on those that deserve it. Although the 
             system was intended to be race neutral, not even taking race into account, the assumptions it made could have been deadly for the minorities who were underrepresented.
        </p>
            
        <p>
            These systems and many others that are being developed are facing similar challenges. Benjamin notes that they would turn out very 
            differently if there was one person involved in the development who knew the necessary history and could flag these issues earlier on. But the 
            absence of this person, in itself, is part of the problem.

        <h3>Racism, My Story</h3>
        <p>I am a white South African male. My journey with racism has been a complicated one. From a very young age, I was taught at school that 
            South Africa was the “Rainbow Nation” and that we all live together in diverse harmony, but what I saw during lunchtime breaks at the 
            very same school told a different story. I saw how the kids of different races sat in isolated groups with other people of the same race. 
            Even in high school we read books such as Americana by Chimimanda Agozi Aditchie and had lengthy discussions about race, but still the segregation 
            during lunch break continued. Over weekends I sat at braais with my friends where they would make racist remarks, leaving me in a position to either 
            laugh so that I am not excluded or to call them out for what they had said and be excluded anyway. I spent December holidays at the coast but 
            was told not to go to the beach on Christmas or New Year’s Day as I would be the only white person there. In my first week of university, 
            I fell victim to the very thing I claim not to be when I assumed a man was uneducated because of his inability to speak English properly only 
            to find out he was busy with his Ph. D in Physics. And now I find myself in the final year of my undergraduate degree and I am afraid. 
            I am afraid that because of my past, the software I develop and the products I create will be inadvertently racist. </p>

        <p>After listening to the interview mentioned above, I immediately reviewed this website’s development and realized I did not have a single 
            picture of a person of colour. I reflected on video game’s I had developed and realized the protagonist which they were centered around, 
            was never a person of colour. I reviewed software systems I had developed and realized I had restrictions that didn’t allow for people’s 
            names to contain any special characters , forgetting that there are languages with more than just our 26 letters and that diacritics, 
            or accent marks, can often be included when naming children. 
        </p>

        <p> 
            It was at this point, that I realized an evident gap in my personal education and how imperative Ruha Benjamin’s recommendation of incorporating 
            racial history into formal education is. Admitting my ignorance was the first step, which a lot of people around me still need to make. 
            My commitment and journey going forward is to expand on my knowledge allowing me to take various socio-political disparities into 
            consideration when developing content in the future.
        </p>

        <p>I completed the Implicit Bias Test for Race and it echoed the personal realization I had come to. It determined that my data suggests a 
            “slight automatic preference to white people compared to black people”. I think the test itself was an interesting and unique experience that 
            could help people with their journeys of introspection. I think it is important for all creators to take this test to identify what their 
            conscious thoughts about race are and start to critically analyze and address them.</p>
