        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Online teaching has been an effective and efficient way for students and educators to connect with one another 
            since the very beginning of the internet’s conception with
            <a href="https://www.thebestschools.org" style="color:white">The Best Schools</a>
            documenting the first fully online programs being founded as early as 1998. Now, more than 20 years later, 
            people around the world are having to embrace online learning like never before.</p>

        <p>The global pandemic, COVID-19, has resulted in more than a third of the world being placed on some degree of lockdown. 
            With people being unable to leave their houses, Schools and Universities are being closed down and forced to adapt 
            their syllabi into fully online courses. Whilst this has resulted in a number of technical and ethical issues, under 
            the dire circumstances, most establishments don’t have a choice.  Let’s look at some of the technologies that can be 
            used to aid this process as well as some of the issues that begin to arise. </p>
        </section>

    <section>
        <h3>Suggested Technologies</h3>
        <p>  From an educators standpoint it is important to remember that students learn in different ways and whilst extensive 
            research has been done into the different types of learners, 
            <a href="https://www.techquarters.com/different-types-of-learners/" style="color:white">Tech Quarters</a>
            explains how they can be broken down into Visual, Audio, Kinaesthetic and Intrapersonal Learners. As an educator, 
            this is imperative when deciding which methods, you are going to use to teach students online as the method you choose 
            must allow for all 4 types of learners to engage with the content</p>

        <p> Using presentation development software such as Microsoft Power Point and Prezi allows you to create slideshows with text 
            and images which is a good start in providing a visual for students. Recording supplementary podcasts and uploading them 
            along with the presentations also allows the students an audio stimulus. Another alternative is to record lectures and upload 
            them on YouTube or any other video streaming platform for students to watch. However, these options do not allow for much 
            interaction between the students and lecturers.</p>

        <p> This is where Online Video Communication Tools such as Zoom and Microsoft Teams are very effective as they allow you to 
            provide a visual for the learners in the form of sharing your screen or having a web camera that records and streams you 
            to them live. Including supplementary readings in the form of uploaded documents, as well as completable exercises will allow 
            educators to engage with all type of learners and ensure they are learning in the most effective ways possible.</p>

        <h3>Accessibility implications</h3>
        <p>Whilst technologies that support online learning do exist and are readily available, not everyone is able to access them. 
            The first concern is that, as a student, you need some sort of computing device to access the internet. Whilst a Desktop or 
            Laptop Computer would be ideal, it is not realistic to assume that students would have access to one. The other option, 
            Mobile Phones could be used as a last resort but even then only 
            <a href="https://www.bankmycell.com/blog/how-many-phones-are-in-the-world" style="color:white">67.95%</a>
            of people have access to them.</p>

        <p>The second major concern is internet access. Whilst some students may have unlimited internet access at home, most students 
            will have restricted internet access or not internet access at all. According to 
            <a href="https://www.oberlo.com/blog/internet-statistics" style="color:white">Oberlo</a>
            only 57% of the world’s population has internet access. Many students acquire access to devices and the internet through 
            the institution they attend but if these institutions are closed, it is evident that a lot of them will be left stranded. </p>
        </section>

    <section>
        <h3> Ethical implications</h3>
        <p> The process of attending an education facility, whether it is a school or tertiary institution, it is about more than 
            just learning the work that has been prescribed. As a student you also learn extremely important life and social skills 
            such as how to interact with people from different walks of life and how to work effectively as a team. A primary ethical 
            issue with online learning is the removal of these sorts of interactions which help develop the student in ways that cannot 
            be tested in an exam.</p>
            
        <p>Privacy and Surveillance is another key ethical implication. With online learning there aren’t many ways to ensure that 
            students are doing the required work or ensuring that they do not cheat when completing an assignment. A possible solution 
            to this is software that allows you to monitor their screens as well as their webcam to ensure they are not cheating; however, 
            this can be seen as an infringement of their privacy so it is difficult to know where to draw the line.</p>

        <h3>International precedent and the challenges they represent in a South African context</h3>
        <p>The international wave of migrating to online learning was in full affect before the COVID-19 pandemic hit with Times Magazine 
            observing the climb of 
            <a href="https://wenr.wes.org/2018/08/educating-the-masses-the-rise-of-online-education" style="color:white">Available Massive Open Online Courses(MOOC) </a>
            grow by 683 percent since 2012 and the number of universities offering these classes grow from 200 to 800. This is because 
            many of the international schools and universities have the resources to develop and support these courses. However, in 
            South Africa there are more than
            <a href="https://pmg.org.za/committee-meeting/21135/" style="color:white">11 252 </a>
            schools located in rural areas across the country. These schools barely have enough resources to educate the kids as is, 
            so there is no possibility of them developing online content for their students. Whilst many universities in South Africa 
            incorporate an internet-based platform into their education this is, as explored in the accessibility implications, 
            often the only form of internet access students have and can only be accessed at the institutions themselves.
