        <h3>Character Rationale</h3>
        <p >My whole life started when I was born in Johannesburg at Olivedale Clinic on the 28th of September 1995. 
            I attend Randpark Primary school but moved to King Edwards School at the beginning of grade 8. Growing up I was 
            never the most well-built. In my primary school phase I was a bit over weight and often got bullied for the way 
            that I look. At a young age I decided to change that so I began learning about exercising and eating healthier, 
            by the time I reached grade I had lost a lot of weight so feeling good about myself I went to the first day of my 
            new school, unfortunately this wasn’t much better. Now I was being ridiculed for being too skinny and was never 
            chosen for the rugby team because I did not have any muscle mass. This is when I began my journey into learning 
            about muscle development and what I needed to do to gain more muscle. After hours of research, training and cooking 
            meals of the course of 4 years, I had finally reached  a point where I was not only happy with the way I looked but 
            it also boosted my self-confidence and I was able to play first team rugby in my Grade 12 year. </p>

        <p> After school I decided to get a formal education in the fitness field, I had fallen in love with, so I got my BSc in 
            Sport Sciences from the University of Pretoria. Along the way I was lucky enough to work with professional athletes like 
            Siya Kolisi, William Bonac and Caster Semenya to mention a few.</p>

        <p>
            Now my life’s journey is to help people who are unhappy with the way they look completely transform themselves 
            through tailor-made training protocols and bespoke diets so that they too can feel the lifestyle and attitude 
            change that comes with a well-built physique. Furthermore, I want to help athletes become the best version of themselves 
            regardless of what their goals are and to educate people as to why certain approaches work instead just telling them what to do.

        <h3>Home Page Vision</h3>
        <p>Currently the homepage contains a styled landing page and about me page. I would like to expand this to include a section with client
            testimonials and results as well as a section that outlines the services that Kent provides and a detailed explanation of each of these 
            sections. I would also like to move the contact me section to the bottom of the home page instead of having it as its own seperate page.
        </p>


        <h3>Training Page Vision</h3>
        <p>
            My vision for the training page is to create a platform on which people can find more information on various training 
            styles and techniques associated with the goal. Upon arriving on the training page users will be prompted to choose 
            from several goals: Weight Loss, Muscle Gain or Strength Gain. There after they will be able to select what type of 
            training equipment, they have available to them: Body Weight, Limited Weight Equipment or Full Commercial gym. After 
            these decisions have been made, they will be redirected to page that contains links and previews of various articles 
            which include workouts that suit their desired goal and available equipment which can be seen on the training page in 
            the form of a wireframe. They will also be notified that these training programs are generic and that if they want a 
            tailor-made one, they simply need to contact Kent, with a button that takes them directly to the contact me page. </p>

        <h3>Nutrition Page Vision</h3>
        <p>
            The vision for the nutrition page will also be a series of filters that will be applied to a number of articles depeding on the 
            users experience allowing for a customized experience of the website and of nutrition. First users will be asked if they prefer a
            certain approach to dieting; Keto, Intermitttent Fasting, Vegetarianism, Veganism, etc and then be redirected to previews and links 
            to articles about their preferred diet approach.  
        </p>

    <section>
        <h3>Events Page Vision</h3>
        <p>
            The vision for the events page is to create a platform that users can visit and find a whole collection of fitness related 
            events that are happening in and around Johannesburg. This could be everything from Warrior Races and Park Runs to 
            Bodybuilding Shows and Expos to cater for the entire fitness industries interests as opposed to just one niche group.
            This also allows Kent's character to be integrated into the city itself and demonstrate how he engages with it.
