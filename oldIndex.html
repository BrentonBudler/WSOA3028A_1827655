                Hi, my name is Kent Wilson, I am a 26 Year Old with a passion for fitness and nutrition.
            </br>I have my BSc in Sports Science from the University of Pretoria and have spent many years in 
            </br>the fitness industry transforming people's bodies and quality of life. This website serves as a platform for 
        </br>me to share my knowledge on fitness and nutrition whilst debunking common myths people have surrounding the fitness lifestyle. 
    </br>It also allows me to connect with people like you, who are looking to trasform themselves, and need someone to show them exactly 
</br>how to reach them. So what are you waiting for? Head to the contact me page and let's start your journey to the best version of yourself.
