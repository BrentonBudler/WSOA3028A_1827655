                Hi, my name is Kent Wilson, I am a 26 Year Old with a passion for fitness and nutrition.
            </br>I have my BSc in Sports Science from the University of Pretoria and have spent many years in 
            </br>the fitness industry transforming people's bodies and quality of life. This website serves as a platform for 
        </br>me to share my knowledge on fitness and nutrition whilst debunking common myths people have surrounding the fitness lifestyle. 
    </br>It also allows me to connect with people like you, who are looking to trasform themselves, and need someone to show them exactly 
</br>how to reach them. So what are you waiting for? Head to the contact me page and let's start your journey to the best version of yourself. 
            </p>

<h3 align = "center"> Website's Future Development</h3>
<p align = "center"> I want the colour scheme for the website to be monochromatic. Featuring black and white images and occasionally splashes of
</br> blue that will be incorporated in the logo as well. As for the website's feel I would like to incorprate seemless transitions 
</br>between pages and the pages themselves will be made up of screen wide blocks that fade in as you scroll down. The training and nutrition pages will have 
</br>thumbnails, previews and links to other articles and the contact me page will have a form that potential clients can fill in.
